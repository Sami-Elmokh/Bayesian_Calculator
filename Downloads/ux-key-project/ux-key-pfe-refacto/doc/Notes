Step 1: Bayesian learning of the parameters of the distribution(beta, gamma)

We assume at this point that the three metrics(intuitiveness, fluidity, speed) are independent. Seeing the graphs of their distributions, we can estimate that they each follow a Gamma distribution. So, at this point, for each metric, we try to get an algorithm that would make an online estimation of the parameters of the distribution through Bayesian learning.
The output of this phase should be a video for the convergence of the parameters, for each metric considered.

Note:
* First, we consider only the distributions in the short file (data/endsomethingthou.csv)
-->to see later on what made the long ones have weird distributions (data collection process,..)
* To take into account the cases of missing values(eg for fluidity) + the extreme values in the distributions(eg not many values for small values of fluidity because it is unrealistic).
